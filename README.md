# Project-07
A Python location tracking app monitors real-time GPS data, logs user movements, and visualizes routes on a map using libraries like geopy for geolocation and folium for mapping. It tracks distance, speed, and duration, enabling analysis of location-based activities for navigation, fitness, or logistics purposes.
